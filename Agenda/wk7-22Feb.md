### Retrospective
* How did it go last week? Any questions?
  * We limited ourselves with the basic process workflow
* Is everyone on [Github](https://github.com/)?
* Reflection
  * Do you like your Activity Sets? 
    * Too easy/hard? What's up - let me know.
  * Things you didnt care for/dislike
  * Things you want to continue doing?

### Programming exercise in Codester
* Open a new project
  * Get a number input 'my_number' from 1-10
  * Write a if comparison to compare the 'my_number' to evuluate your number
  * For example - 'my_number' is 4; 
  ```
    my_number = int(input("Number?"))
    if my_number == 4:
        print "%i equals 4" % my_number
    if my_number != 10:
        print "%i does not equal 10" % my_number
    if my_number < 5:
        print "%i is less than 5" % my_number
    if my_number > 0:
        print "%i is more than 0" % my_number
    if my_number <= 4:
        print "%i is less than " % my_number
        print "or equal to 4"
  ```
