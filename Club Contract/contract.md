# Club Contract - Our Promise to Each other

> Sisterhood means supporting other girls when theyâ€™re being brave and making ambitious choices. As a girl who codes, you are being brave by learning a subject where you will make mistakes and learn from them. Additionally, you are joining a huge group of other Girls Who Code members who will support you in this challenge! They are there for you when you encounter obstacles, and you will work to be there for them as well.
