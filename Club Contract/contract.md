# Club Contract
## Part 1: Activity Frame and Defining Sisterhood (5 mins)
* Frame the activity by sharing the purpose in your own words.
* Ask girls why having expectations and norms might be important.
* Share with the Girls Who Code definition of sisterhood with your Club. Ask them what the definition, and how can be incorporated into their Club Contract.

> Sisterhood means supporting other girls when they’re being brave and making ambitious choices. As a girl who codes, you are being brave by learning a subject where you will make mistakes and learn from them. Additionally, you are joining a huge group of other Girls Who Code members who will support you in this challenge! They are there for you when you encounter obstacles, and you will work to be there for them as well.

## Part 2: Co-Develop the Contract (10 mins)
* Model an example of what girls might want to include in their contract. For example:
* Ask for help when you need it.
* Select a volunteer to write down what other girls want on their contract on the large piece of paper.
* Give your Club space to discuss what they want to include.
* Observe the conversation and encourage girls to speak up if they haven’t said anything. It is important for all voices to be included.
* Once everyone has been heard, all members of your Club, including you, should sign your Club Contract.
* Tell girls that this Contract will hang during their meetings to help them remember the expectations they set.

## Part 3: Develop the Team Flag and Onboarding (15 mins)
* Inform girls that they are now truly a part of the Girls Who Code Community!
* Their final task is to create a Club banner or flag that represents their unique Club identity. Have girls work together to design and decorate their flag.
